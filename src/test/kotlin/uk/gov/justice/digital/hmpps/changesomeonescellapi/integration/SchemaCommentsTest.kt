/**
 * Guards the data dictionary published to GitHub Pages (see
 * src/main/resources/db/migration/V6__schema_comments.sql).
 *
 * Descriptions live in the database as COMMENT ON statements so SchemaSpy, the CSV export and any
 * Glue crawl share one source of truth. Nothing else would notice a new column arriving undocumented.
 * This schema is small enough today that the dictionary is cheap to keep complete - which is the
 * point of adding the guard now rather than once it has grown.
 *
 * The relkind filter includes 'v' as well as 'r'. There are no views today, but one added later would
 * otherwise slip into the published report undocumented.
